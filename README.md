# QuickCSS

A [QuickSCSS][quickscss] usage template, for Custom/Quick CSS in Discord client mods.

## Usage
1. [Create a copy of the template][generate].
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm i`.
3. Edit the contents of `scss/` to your liking.
4. Run `pnpm build` to compile once, or `pnpm watch` to compile on file changes.

## Notes
- File structure inside `scss/` is a suggestion only, only `main.scss` is required.
- This will overwrite your existing custom/quick CSS, so make sure to back it up first.
